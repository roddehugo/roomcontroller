# Playground with the Linux Framebuffer

## What is a frame buffer device?

Taken from Geert Uytterhoeven's framebuffer.txt in the linux kernel sources:

> A framebuffer device is an abstraction for the graphic hardware. It represents
> the frame buffer of some video hardware, and allows application software to
> access the graphic hardware through a well-defined interface, so that the
> software doesn't need to know anything about the low-level interface stuff.

## Why use the frame buffer directly?

The frame buffer device is a very low-level interface to display something on
the screen. Speaking about an embedded GUI there are several reasons to use the
frame buffer directly instead of a Window manager:

- simple: just write the pixels to a memory
- fast: no window manager which means fast boot and less overhead
- portable: independently from the distribution every Linux system has a frame
buffer device so it's compatible with all of them

More detailed information can be found in the great manifest for Raspberry Pi
Wiki about the [framebuffer][framebuffer] and the [framebuffer
console][framebuffer-console].

## Compile examples

Single C source file should compile well on any Unix OS with `make` command:

    make fbinfo && ./fbinfo
    make fbmmap && ./fbmmap

It leverages [Make implicit rules][make-implicit-rules].

### Credits

For `fbinfo`, see [low level graphics on Raspberry Pi][fbinfo]. For `fbmmap`,
see [enabling the linux framebuffer][fbmmap] from Qt docs.

## Commands

### Quickly output bytes to `linuxfb`

One may need `sudo` depending on the file permissions to run [dd][dd].
Error like `No space left on device` is expected.

    # Output random pixel noise
    dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/fb0

    # Clear framebuffer
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fb0

### Get information about a framebuffer

Print detailed information. Optional `fb` parameter to fall back on default.

    fbset -fb /dev/fb0 -i

Initialize the framebuffer if _disabled_ by a remapping of the framebuffer
console via a [kernel parameter][kernel-parameter]. Soft reset when coupled with
clear framebuffer command. A call like `con2fbmap 1 0` is needed to actually get
the framebuffer working with `linuxfb` API.

    fbset -fb /dev/fb0 "640x480-60"

See `/etc/fb.modes`.

### Disable cursor blinking in framebuffer console

    vt.global_cursor_default=0

### Disable framebuffer console before boot

Add this kernel parameter to disable console framebuffer `fb0`:

    fbcon=map:1

From [The Framebuffer Console][kernel-framebuffer-console]:

> 3 . fbcon=map:<0123>

> This is an interesting option. It tells which driver gets mapped to which
> console. The value '0123' is a sequence that gets repeated until the total
> length is 64 which is the number of consoles available. In the above example,
> it is expanded to 012301230123... and the mapping will be:

>     tty | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
>     fb  | 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 ...

> (`cat /proc/fb` should tell you what the fb numbers are)

> One side effect that may be useful is using a map value that exceeds the
> number of loaded fb drivers. For example, if only one driver is available,
    > `fb0`, adding `fbcon=map:1` tells fbcon not to take over the console.

> Later on, when you want to map the console the to the framebuffer device, you
> can use the `con2fbmap` utility.

More details about the [con2fbmap utility][con2fbmap].

## TFT LCD display modules

As per [Linux Framebuffer drivers for small TFT LCD display][git-notro-fbtft]:

> 2015-01-19
> The FBTFT drivers are now in the Linux kernel staging tree:
> https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git/tree/drivers/staging/fbtft?h=staging-testing
> Development in this github repo has ceased.

If one wants to read someone struggling to setup its [LCD driver at
boot][lcd-driver-boot], as of Octobre 2015. Hence a little outdated.

## Going further

Read the [Framebuffer HOWTO][framebuffer-howto] by Alex Buell (2010):

> This document describes how to use the framebuffer devices in Linux with a
> variety of platforms. This also includes how to set up multi-headed
> displays.
